# Time Travel Zine

This is my small Git project where I’m making a zine (mini magazine) about time travel. I’m using Git to learn how branches, issues, and pull requests work.

## Folders
- `zine/` – has the zine files  
- `.gitignore` – tells Git which files to skip  
- `README.md` – this file

## Branches
- `author/idea-sprint` – where I write new ideas  
- `editor/review` – where I check and edit stuff

## .gitignore Info
The `.gitignore` file helps keep out files that don’t need to be in the repo, like build files or random system stuff.
